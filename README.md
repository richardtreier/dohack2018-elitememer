# DoHack 2018: The "EliteMemers" Project
A Project made during the DoHack 2018 Hackathon at Adesso Dortmund by Berkan Diler, Niklas Portmann, Sebastian Trzpiot und Richard Treier.

"EliteMemer" is a Tinder-similar app for true memers to find other memers with similar interests, likes and personality. A true memer expresses himself with his memes of choice. Memers can swipe memes to the right and left. Memers are matched by their common likes while avoiding memers with conflicting tastes.
